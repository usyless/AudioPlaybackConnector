# AudioPlaybackConnector

Includes fixes/improvements from other forks and removes things I don't need.

Bluetooth audio playback (A2DP Sink) connector for Windows 10 2004+.

Microsoft added Bluetooth A2DP Sink to Windows 10 2004. However, a third-party app is required to manage connection.\
There is already an app can do this job. However it can't hide to notification area and it's not open-source.\
So I write this app, provide a simple, modern and open-source alternative.

# Usage
* Download and run AudioPlaybackConnector from the releases.
* Add a bluetooth device in system bluetooth settings. You can right click AudioPlaybackConnector icon in notification area and select "Bluetooth Settings".
* Click AudioPlaybackConnector icon and select the device you want to connect.
* Enjoy!
